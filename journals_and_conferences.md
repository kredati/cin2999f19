# Journals and Conferences blurbs
#### Due by Friday, October 4, at 11:59pm.

Your job is to select two items:
* a journal that looks interesting to you from [the SCMS journals list](https://www.cmstudies.org/page/resource_journals_AF), 
* and a conference that looks interesting to you from our [conferences list](./conferences.md). 

For each of these, consult various online materials to work up a picture of each. These might include: what they say about themselves in about pages; perusal of recent past programs or tables of contents in recent issues; editorial board composition; submissions guidelines; etc.

You should select conferences and journals that are tractable for this assignment: do not try to do this exercise for graduate student conferences, for example, since they are not likely to have the online presence or infrastructure that will give you the information you need for this exercise.

Each blurb should be very brief (100–250 words), and you should not take more than 20–30 minutes to actually perform this activity.

Post your blurbs, with relevant links (to conference or journal website, at minimum) to Slack, in the #reports channel.

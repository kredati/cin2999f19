# Resources
Here you’ll find a lists and links (and lists of links) to different kinds of resources that may be of interest to you as you continue in the program. I cannot vouch for everything here; I can vouch that everything here has been recommended in some serious way by somebody I trust.

## Books
Below is a list of books that may help, in a few categories
* [On writing](#On-writing)
* [On the profession](#On-the-profession)
* [On process](#On-process)

#### On writing
##### All three of our required books:
* Joan Bolker, _Writing Your Dissertation in Fifteen Minutes a Day_ <br /> This book stresses process over product, and contains a great deal of hard-won and sensible practical wisdom. The title is bad; the book is very good.
* Eric Hayot, _The Elements of Academic Style: Writing for the Humanities_ <br /> This is one opinionated take on academic writing. I appreciate all of the opinions, if disagree with some of them. That said, it’s clearly written and compellingly presented and will probably serve you very well.
* Wayne Booth et al., _The Craft of Research_ <br /> I _believe_ in this book; it has oriented much of how I write and teach writing. It’s technical, and sometimes it feels elementary. It is not: it is _explicit_ in ways that only appear simplistic.

##### Books that others have recommended, or which I have not assigned:
* Joseph Williams, _Style: Towards Clarity and Grace_ (Chicago: 1990). <br /> Hayot is very high on this book. I have not read it, but have heard others also enthuse. Its emphasis is on the technical craft of prose.
* Wendy Belcher, _Writing Your Journal Article in Twelve Weeks_ (Chicago, 2019). <br /> This was recommended to me as a first-year assistant professor; I did not like it ands set it aside. Others _swear_ by it, especially those who didn’t pick up academic culture by forced osmosis. I suspect if I had been more receptive to the idea that I needed help with my process, I imagine I would have had a very different experience of this book.

#### On the profession
* Gregory Colón Semenza, _Graduate Study for the 21st Century: How to Build an Academic Career in the Humanities_ (Palgrave, 2010). <br /> I don’t love this book, and disagree with it on more than a few counts. That said, it’s the standard how-to book in getting through a PhD. If you do what it says, you’ll probably do well in professional terms; personally, its prescriptions for 70-hour weeks will probably take a toll.
* Karen Kelsky, _The Professor is In: The Essential Guide to Turning your PhD into a Job_ (Three Rivers, 2015). <br /> This book is a collection of blog posts that has been lightly revised, and it shows. Short chapters address practical concerns regarding the job market in a digestible way. It also addresses, in a sane way, career trajectories other than the tenure track. Its tone is sometimes more breathless than perhaps it needs to be; it is, after all, marketing for Kelsky’s professional services, for which she charges.
* Robert L. Peters, _Getting What You Came For: The Smart Student’s Guide to Earning an M.A. or a Ph.D._ (Farrar, Strauss, and Giroux, 1997). <br /> Some people _swear_ by this book; I don’t know it. What I have heard especially praised is its guidance for minoritized, marginalized, and first-generation graduate students.
* Greg Colón Semenza and Garrett A. Sullivan, Jr., eds., _How to Build a Life in the Humanities_ (Palgrave, 2015). <br /> The self-proclaimed sequel to _Graduate Study for the 21st Century_, this book is a collection of essays about faculty life. This book can give you a sense of the breadth of experiences in the academy, which may well be salutary in moments of claustrophobia, in which it feels like there’s only one right way to go about being an academic.

### On process
* David Allen, _Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity_ (Penguin, 2015). <br /> The classic. I try, and fail, to follow its prescriptions. (Neoliberal self-optimized productivity is just like modernism: “Try again. Fail again. Fail better.” [Beckett]) A system, a practice, and an outlook for how to manage your projects. I suspect that the necessity of such a system may not seem very obvious at your stage; as you move into faculty life with more plates spinning, something like this will start to feel _very_ necessary.
* Hayot’s _Elements of Academic Style_ has very useful pragmatic prescriptions for the writing process.
* Bolker’s _Writing Your Dissertation_ has even more useful ways to think about such prescriptions, and how to consider your relation to them.

## Other resources
### Software
* _Citation management_: **Zotero**, https://zotero.org. The open-source research– and citation-manager. I recommend you get into a habit of using this (or some other citation management software) early and often. Zotero may (or may not) be the best out there, but sticking with free and open-source software will pay off in the long run. (FWIW, I use [BibDesk](https://bibdesk.sourceforge.io/), but that’s because I’m an annoying computer geek who insists on writing in plain text using markdown.)
* _Writing_: **Scrivener**, https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview. I used this for years. Purpose-built software for writing long, structured documents is a _vast_ improvement over general-purpose word processors, especially Microsoft Word. Your dissertation will have to be formatted according to very strict guidelines, and this will be a giant pain in the ass no matter what you do; Word elevates that process to exquisite torture.
* _Process writing & notes_: I do not use specialized software for this: I use a combination of paper and plain-text and GitHub tools. Scrivener will work well enough if you really learn how to use it. Some people _love_ certain kinds of note-taking software, including Microsoft’s [OneNote](https://onenote.com) (which you get for free at U of T) and [OmniOutliner](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnioutliner).
* _Project management_: I don’t have a strong recommendation. I use OmniFocus (https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus), but it’s probably overkill for most grad students. If you’re in the Apple techworld, the built-in Mac & iOS Reminders app will probably work just fine. People have had good things to say about [Remember the Milk](https://www.rememberthemilk.com/) and [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/).
* _Time management_: If you are using the Pomodoro technique, I note the useful existence of [MyTomatoes.com](http://mytomatoes.com) and also the [BeFocused app on the iOS app store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/be-focused-focus-timer/id973130201).

### Campus services
* [Gradlife](http://www.sgs.utoronto.ca/gradlife/Pages/default.aspx). This is U of T’s portal for all grad student services & support. It’s a good place to start when you don’t know where to look.
* [Essential guide for grads](http://www.sgs.utoronto.ca/Documents/EssentialGuideforGrads.pdf). This puts all of the things into a single PDF document that serves as a good orientation and overview. Also, it’s full-text searchable, which can be a better tool for finding what you need than all the links on the Gradlife page.
* [Graduate Conflict Resolution Centre](http://gradcrc.utoronto.ca/). This is probably your first stop if you’re having a procedural, advising, interpersonal, time-management, or other work-oriented crisis. They have peer advisors available for appointment-based sessions and scheduled drop-ins who are trained to listen, de-escalate, and connect students to the resources that can help. They also have an especially useful list of [grad student resources](http://gradcrc.utoronto.ca/grad-student-resources/) that’s a good jumping off point for identifying campus resources for a variety of problems (mental health, family planning, homelessness, landlord conflicts, international student issues, conflicts with your supervisor, &c.).
* [Graduate Centre for Academic Communication](http://www.sgs.utoronto.ca/currentstudents/Pages/GCAC-Workshops.aspx) offers workshops in writing and presentation skills. This may seem redundant or remedial; I have nevertheless heard good things, especially for students for whom English is not their first language.

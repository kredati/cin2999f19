# Summer courses
## Proposing a course to teach in the summer of year 3

Students have the opportunity to teach a course of their own design during their PhD program, typically (but not always) in the summer following their third year. Because there are more students in a cohort than available course slots, courses are allocated based on an application to the Undergraduate Committee. Which courses are selected are based on a number of factors, including standing in the program, curricular need, and quality of prospective course materials.

### Application parameters from 2018/19
The following is what the Undergraduate Committee posted as the constituents of an application in November of 2018:
1. A title and 400-500 word description for the course you are proposing.  In the description, please be sure to discuss the topic of the course, the manner in which the course will be structured, key learning outcomes or goals for it, and some representative texts (with readings and screenings).
2. An indication of whether you are conceiving of this as a 200-level or a 300-level course specifically, or if you are open to it being either.  (For a better sense of what kinds of courses we have at these two levels, you can see a full list of our offerings at https://fas.calendar.utoronto.ca/section/Cinema-Studies-Institute.)
3. An indication of which session(s) you are available for and which you prefer, as well as whether you are open to the possibility of teaching at night.
4. Two letters of recommendation: once from your supervisor and one from a faculty member for whom you have served as a TA.

# A reverse timeline
This document is wildly opinionated, and has not been vetted by my colleagues. At every stage of this: the word of the graduate coordinator and/or your supervisor supervenes whatever is here.

This timeline is meant to serve as a regulative ideal, where the eventual goal is tenure at a research-intensive institution (R1). That said, this ideal is _very, very rare_. Your author’s path to tenure did not follow this template exactly, and many of the faculty members in CSI did not, either. This is a starting point for the inevitable improvisation, and departures from this path are not only _not failures_, but also sometimes cause for celebration. Also, it is worth noting that this is, as a general rule, a conservative and somewhat over-performing timeline: tenure standards may fully consider a book whose final manuscript has been submitted and accepted, but not yet published or in production; you may well get a job with a single essay accepted. (By the same token, some institutions have _higher_ tenure standards; getting on the tenure track may require a more substantial research portfolio than I present here, particularly at certain kinds of institutions.)

### The tenure-track faculty timeline
#### Year 6: The tenure case
* Manage your anxiety about high-stakes judgment from your tenured peers & colleagues.
* Continue work on your second project, submitting an article from it.

_By this point_:
* Book in press or in print.
* 5+ (a minimum of 3) essays/articles in print or in press, 2 (minimum of 1) which should not be from the book.
* A second major project framed and under way.
* Tenure case submitted.

#### Year 5: The second project and the tenure case
* Move the book through the production process—subventions, images & permissions, copy editing, proofing, indexing, etc.
* Present initial work from your second project at two conferences
* Prepare and submit an essay from second major project.
* Prepare your tenure file; processes differ from institution to institution, but it will be due somewhere between May and September.

_By this point_:
* Final book manuscript submitted.
* A second major project framed.
* 2 or 3 essays drawn from/related to the book published or in press.

#### Year 4: Completing your book, while pivoting to the next project
* Mid-tenure review is underway.
* Finish revisions to the book and resubmit the (hopefully final) manuscript.
* Read, research, develop, and deepen your second project; propose material from the second project to major conferences.
* At many (research-intensive) institutions, you may have a semester off in this year. Use this time to complete your manuscript.

#### Year 3: A book contract and mid-tenure review.
* By the end o

#### Year 2:

#### Year 1:

### The interregnum
A large majority of people find that they cannot

### The PhD
Realistically, a PhD takes six years to complete. This five-year-plan is aggressive, and also

Your portfolio coming out of the PhD includes:
* A completed dissertation.
* Two journal articles, the closer to published the better. One should be a dissertation chapter, one your best seminar paper from coursework.
* Three conference presentations, at least two of which are at major conferences, at least one of which should be at SCMS.
* A single book review.
* A plan for revising your dissertation into a book.
* A fantasy of a research trajectory for your tenure-track experience.

#### Year 5
* Apply for jobs (September through November, or January, or March).
* Revise chapter 3.
* Complete the last chapter of your dissertation.
* Write a
* Defend your dissertation! (Plan on a defense date not later than the end of June.)

#### Year 4
* Revise your first chapter in light of comments from your supervisor(y committee).
* Revise your submitted first article and resubmit.
* At the same time, complete two additional dissertation chapters. At slowest, write one during the year; one during the summer. The faster you do this, the better.
* By April at the latest, you should have revised your first chapter and completed a solid draft of your second.
* Once you have your second chapter, start strategizing with your supervisor about preparing for the job market.
* In consultation with your supervisor, revise one of your first two chapters for publication.

#### Year 3
* Complete a dissertation prospectus. (First draft: September; approved: absolutely not later than the end of November.)
* Start writing your first dissertation chapter (December [winter break] and on).
* Present work-in-progress from this dissertation chapter at SCMS (end of March).
* Complete your first dissertation chapter, the earlier the better; end of July is realistic and gives your supervisor(y committee) enough time to read & respond before the beginning of the school year.
* Any field research you must do should take place during this summer.
* Revise your best seminar paper for publication. Submit it by the end of April, so that you can use the summer for intensive work on your dissertation.

#### Year 2: The end of coursework, and exams
* One term of coursework (September through December).
* This proseminar!
* Select a supervisor (September, or at the latest, October).
* Study for, and take, special field exams. (January through June)
* Continue to develop your intellectual problems, formulating an idea for a dissertation (throughout the year).
* Begin work in earnest on a dissertation proposal (July & August).
* End of August: apply for SCMS with dissertation-related work (preferably from your first chapter).

#### Year 1: Coursework
* Take all the classes.
* Write a lot of seminar papers.
* Develop a set of intellectual problems.
* Get the lay of the land: faculty, students, etc.

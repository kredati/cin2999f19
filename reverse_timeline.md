# A reverse timeline
## The eleven-year plan
This document is wildly opinionated, and is meant to be my own opinion. It has not been vetted by my colleagues. At every stage of this: the word of the graduate coordinator and/or your supervisor and/or your mentors and department chairs supervenes whatever is here.

This timeline is meant to serve as a minimally practical regulative ideal, where the eventual goal is tenure at a research-intensive (R1) institution, since that is (in large part) what the PhD trains you for, and (for reasons noted below) are probably the aspirational norm for most graduate students and tenure-track faculty, regardless of their institutional contexts. That said, this ideal is _very, very rare_. Your author’s path to tenure did not follow this template especially well, and many of the faculty members in CSI did not follow it, either. This is a starting point for inevitable improvisation, and departures from this path are not only _not failures_, but also sometimes cause for actual celebration. Also, it is a starting point for negotiating your particular situation with your supervisor and committee. They may have differing opinions about what’s appropriate or salutary in your particular situation.

It is worth noting that this is, as a general rule, a conservative and somewhat over-performing timeline: tenure standards at an institution may fully consider a book whose final manuscript has been submitted and accepted, but not yet published or in production; you may well get a job with a single essay accepted. (By the same token, some institutions have _higher_ tenure standards; getting on the tenure track may require a more substantial research portfolio than I present here, particularly at certain kinds of institutions.)

In addition, this is not a comprehensive plan. I don’t address service (do the service that interests you, learn how to say no, etc.), and I don’t address teaching (get better consistently, find ways to make teaching sustaining & exciting, find ways to contain teaching to as little bandwidth as possible). I only address granting tangentially because it is so contingent on institutional factors. Also, this timeline can be delayed and/or deferred in a bunch of ways, from parental leave stopping a tenure clock for a year to changing jobs resetting the clock entirely. I don’t dwell in all the details. For where you might find holes, here are some rules of thumb.

### Conferences on the tenure track
You should consider that attending two or more major conferences per year is normative on the tenure track; one per year is normative for advanced (year 3+) graduate students. Note that funding such conference travel may well prove difficult; do what you can given your circumstances. That said, conferences are important for a few reasons:

* **Conferences are great commitment mechanisms.** There is no deadline like having to show up in front of people with a fully-realized presentation. That said, to make this count, _every conference presentation should develop part of your tenure portfolio_. Do not say yes to things just because people you like or are impressed by are putting them together; say yes to a thing because of that _and_ you’ve figured out how to project your interests and projects into the call.
* **Conferences give you intermediate feedback.** Depending on your institution, you may find it difficult to discover, invent, or arrange situations where you get meaningful feedback on your work. If you have a habit of going to SCMS every year, you will develop a group of people who come to, and respond to, your work.
* **Conferences are important places to network.** Networking (ugh, I loathe that word) is crucial on the tenure track, because you will need to have a high-level view of your field, and you will need develop a reputation for yourself, and because you will need to develop an intellectual community of people—and, sadly, your faculty colleagues at your institution will in all likelihood not really meet that need. So on the one hand, it lets you see what people in your field are working on, and encounter the work people you haven’t met or heard of before (which will be important, say, for recommending reviewers for your book or your tenure case). On the other hand, your work will get known over time, especially as you develop lateral (peer) community.

### Standards of productivity
A normative solid tenure case at a research institution is often understood to be “a book and five articles.” That said, you may find exceptions to this:
* Some institutions will allow for an “articles” case, if you don’t want to write a book. If you’re content to get tenure at those institutions, write lots of essays: two per year, instead of one per year.
* A good rule of thumb for ongoing productivity with a book-and-articles case is a new essay every year. That said, that level of productivity can be difficult-to-impossible to maintain while you are also writing books. Don’t sweat yearly production goals so long as you are making progress and are generally up to snuff on the timeline below.
* Note that to meet these standards of productivity, you will end up writing essays that are not from the book and not from the second book project. This is a good thing! They may actually lead you to your second project. Staying interested in things that aren't on the straight-and-narrow is a very good idea, and shows depth & range as a scholar. That said, they should not be totally from left field. Possibilities for this work include: unrevised seminar papers from grad school; études in which you play out a theme or problem from your book in relation to a different case; trying to develop the problems you discover, but do not solve, in the book; or, simply, new ideas that don't (yet, ever) come together as a project. Make sure some of your work reading is undirected, organized by curiosity and sense of discovery. Use your teaching and your time at conferences to learn how to become fascinated by things.
* Some institutions (the Ivy League especially but not only) has substantially higher standards of productivity (two books!), and sometimes longer tenure tracks to match (nine years!). They will also typically match these with comparatively greater resources. And: they will demand you meet standards not only of quantity (books just count as long as they’re with “good enough” presses) but also of quality (do _we_, your colleagues, think your work is _good enough_).
* Most institutions, however, have _lower_ standards of productivity for tenure than research-intensive institutions. This, however, does not mean you should plan for those lower standards. I understand this is deeply perverse. However, If you wish to be mobile at all during your tenure track, changing positions to an institution that is more to your liking on some dimension (atmosphere, students, program, prestige, location, teaching load, and so on), you will have to maintain the normative standard of productivity to be competitive on the job market—which is the R1 tenure case. You will be competing for any faculty position with people who hit this level of research output. Teaching loads increase as you descend the prestige scale, so this schedule may become impractical or unworkable; that does not, perversely, make it any less normative to the job market. You will have to make your own bargains with what gives when you are teaching three or four courses per semester, and/or through summers.
* Finally, a note on standards of quality: I believe (and this really is my own full opinion, others do differ on this count) that we are at the point where the quantity of research output cannot increase for most normal human persons while maintaining the standards of quality. From my position—recently tenured, less recently on the job market, having served on a search committee in the past year, having mentored a few students into tenure-track jobs, and so on—it does not seem especially desirable or valuable to overshoot this level of productivity, especially if you’re not producing the best research you can. (A former student of mine wrote a book before they landed a tenure-track job, and the department that hired them is requiring them to write a second book to get tenure. “Overproduction” can really hurt.) Once you hit this standard, you should apply yourself to increase the quality of your work—the writing, the conceptual ambition, the depth of archival work, &c.

### The tenure-track faculty timeline
#### Year 6: The tenure case
* Manage your anxiety about high-stakes judgment from your tenured peers & colleagues.
* Continue work on your second project, doing research.
* Submit a second article related to your second project.

_By this point_:
* First book in press or in print.
* 5+ (a minimum of 3) essays/articles in print or in press, 2 (minimum of 1) which should not be from the book.
* A second major project framed and under way, with conference presentations and an essay at minimum in submission.
* A consistent record of presenting at conferences.
* Tenure case submitted.

#### Year 5: The second project and the tenure case
* Move the book through the production process—subventions, images & permissions, copy editing, proofing, indexing, etc.
* Present initial work from your second project at two conferences.
* Prepare and submit an essay from the second major project.
* Prepare your tenure file; processes differ from institution to institution, but it will be due somewhere between May and October.

_By this point_:
* First book final manuscript submitted.
* A second major project framed with research underway.
* 2 or 3 essays drawn from to the book published or in press.
* One essay not from the book (related to it, perhaps) published or in press.

#### Year 4: Completing your book, while pivoting to the next project
* Mid-tenure review is underway. You will receive the outcome with some feedback; develop a plan to respond to the feedback from the mid-tenure review in the time before your tenure case is due.
* Finish revisions to the book and resubmit the (hopefully final) manuscript.
* Read, research, develop, and deepen your second project; propose material from the second project to major conferences.
* At many (research-intensive) institutions, you may have a semester of research leave in this year. Use this time to complete your manuscript, writing any new material for the book, and to catch up with your article production schedule.
* A good idea at this point is to write and submit an “étude” essay that plays out some of your book’s ideas in relation to a case that is not in the book.

_By this point_:
* Mid-tenure review materials have been submitted.
* Book contract has been signed.
* Two essays from your time on the tenure track are in press or in print (possibly one is still in revision).

#### Year 3: A book contract and mid-tenure review.
* Draft a book proposal and related materials. These will likely include a proposal (to a press’s specifications), an introduction, and two sample chapters. This will mean (likely) writing a new introduction, and polishing chapters mostly as is. (NB: You will likely need to write yet another introduction as part of the revision process.)
* Submit book proposal materials to your chosen university press. (NB: Some presses, like Duke, do not consider incomplete manuscripts. Adjust accordingly.)
* Receive book reader reports. Working with your editor, draft a plan for revision and submit it.
* Receive & sign book contract for first book.
* Prepare materials for your mid-tenure review. What this involves varies widely by institution. Be proactive and seek out institutional mentorship and support.

_By this point_:
* Two chapters from your book accepted.
* New research, from your “[unfinished business](./on_proposals.md#plan-for-unfinished-business),” in hand.
* New/revised framing developed and developing in writing (book proposal, new introduction, etc.).

#### Year 2:
* Identify university presses (or other academic publishers) that are a good fit for your first book.
* Develop a book “elevator pitch” for acquisitions editors.
* Schedule meetings at SCMS with book editors from at minimum two presses that are plausible homes for your book.
* Continue research and revision on all parts of your book. Spend particular time writing into framing. Start work on a new introduction.
* Consider your granting needs. If you must, should, or want to apply for money (SSHRC, NEH, etc.), this is a good time to start working on that.

_By this point_:
* Two chapters from your book accepted (in submission at least). One of these will be from your time as a graduate student or during the Interregnum; these essays count. Their purpose here is to show that at least part of your book project has been vetted by peer review. (NB: This will probably be the most you should publish from your first book. A rule of thumb is that presses will not want more than half the chapters to be published as articles.)

#### Year 1:
* Develop a plan for your next 1, 2, 3, and 6 years. This will include publication, research, and granting. Adjust this timeline to institutional needs and resources, any job changes you think you might need, etc. Keep the focus soft, especially as you get past the two-year mark.
* Get adjusted to faculty life, develop a lifeworld in a new city, etc. (Only exceptional people get much done during their first year as a professor.)
* Develop relationships with mentors outside your PhD program: senior faculty colleagues at your new institution, and in the field at large.
* Research and writing on the “[unfinished business](./on_proposals.md#plan-for-unfinished-business)” of your dissertation. Develop a plan for expansion and revision.
* Present at two conferences. One or both of these must be new material for your book (i.e. the “[unfinished business](./on_proposals.md#plan-for-unfinished-business)”).
* Stop calling it a dissertation and start calling it a book.
* In the summer, revise one book chapter into an essay and submit it to a journal.

_By this point_:
* PhD in hand.
* Two publications, one from your dissertation, and one not.
* A set of conferences you would like to keep going to, and some you want to go to.
* A plan for developing your dissertation into a book.

### The interregnum
A large majority of people find that they cannot step straight from their PhD program into a tenure-track job. You may wish to stay in the PhD program for an additional year, working on your “[unfinished business](./on_proposals.md#plan-for-unfinished-business)” as an enrolled student, and dedicating your time to staying afloat and applying for jobs again. Taking sessional positions outside of U of T while remaining enrolled is not the worst plan. Postdocs are often good, but be careful of them, especially in the Canadian system, as they tend to encourage one-off projects, and ours is a book field (even in Canada), which means sustained years-long work on a single project; ensure that any seeming one-off projects for (say) a SSHRC-funded postdoc are in the service of the book project, and maintaining a coherent research trajectory. Either way, you must find some way to continue to add lines to your CV while you are here without getting too far along on a book, or publishing too much from your dissertation.

You should make a deal with yourself about how many times you will go on the job market in advance of going out the first time. It’s exhausting and time consuming and saps your emotional well-being. Develop a Plan B which you will prepare for in stages, each time putting more energy into plans to leave the academy. Good Plan Bs always, always require preparation. The earlier you start developing them, the better off you’ll be.

### The PhD
Realistically, a PhD takes six years to complete. This five-year-plan is aggressive. Even if you get to a complete dissertation by May or June of year 5, you will often find the bureaucracy of defending and the job application will take place in a 6th year.

Your portfolio coming out of the PhD includes:
* A completed dissertation.
* Two journal articles, the closer to published the better. One should be a dissertation chapter, one your best seminar paper from coursework.
* Three conference presentations, at least two of which are at major conferences, at least one of which should be at SCMS.
* A single book review.
* A plan for revising your dissertation into a book.
* A fantasy of a research trajectory for your tenure-track experience.
* A portfolio for the job market, which includes:
  - A job letter.
  - A CV.
  - Three letters of recommendation from faculty members, uploaded and ready to go on Interfolio.
  - A set of additional materials (a “teaching statement,” a “diversity statement,” a “teaching portfolio,” a “research statement,” &c.)
  - A writing sample (normally, the piece you have published from your dissertation).
  - A job talk (normally, the best chapter of your dissertation that isn’t the one you submitted for publication).
  - A canned teaching demonstration.

In addition to the above, you should be bringing with you a hefty portfolio of “[unfinished business](./on_proposals.md#plan-for-unfinished-business).” (In fact, if you take my advice on [writing a proposal](./on-proposals.md), you should have built-in unfinished business.)

#### Year 5
* Apply for jobs (September through November, or January, or March—depending on how far you get). If necessary, apply for jobs on the “secondary” (non-tenure-track) market (March through July or even August). See above for the set of materials you’ll likely have to generate to apply for jobs.
* Revise chapter 3.
* Complete the last chapter of your dissertation; do not worry very much about revising it.
* Write an introduction to your dissertation. (Also don’t worry very much about this—it will be the first of _many_ introductions you write to this project.)
* Complete a final draft of your dissertation not later than the end of March. This will seem cruelly early; it is. The bureaucracy of finishing a dissertation is vast and slow. (Your external reader must receive the final dissertation at least 8 weeks before a defense.)
* Defend your dissertation! (Plan on a defense date not later than the end of June.)

#### Year 4
* Revise your first chapter in light of comments from your supervisor(y committee).
* Revise your submitted first article and resubmit.
* At the same time, complete two additional dissertation chapters. At slowest, write one during the year; one during the summer. The faster you do this, the better.
* By April at the latest, you should have revised your first chapter and completed a solid draft of your second.
* Once you have completed this solid draft of a second chapter, start strategizing with your supervisor about preparing for the job market. _This conversation should take place absolutely not later than June of your 4th year (and any academic year before you go on the job market)._
* In consultation with your supervisor, revise one of your first two chapters for publication and submit it.

_By now_:
* You have an approved dissertation proposal.
* You have completed a draft of your first dissertation chapter.
* You have done the lion’s share of fieldwork.
* You have presented work from your first dissertation chapter at SCMS.
* You have submitted your first essay for publication.

#### Year 3
* Complete a dissertation prospectus. (First draft: September; approved: absolutely not later than the end of November.)
* Apply for a summer course in summer of year 3, if you wish.
* Consult with your supervisor about fieldwork and funding it.
* Start writing your first dissertation chapter (starting in December [winter break] and after).
* Present work-in-progress from this dissertation chapter at SCMS (end of March).
* Complete your first dissertation chapter, the earlier the better; end of July is a hard deadline realistic and gives your supervisor(y committee) enough time to read & respond before the beginning of the school year.
* Any (or at least most) field research you must do should take place during this summer.
* Teach your summer course, if you are; note that field research may take priority over summer teaching.
* Revise your best seminar paper for publication. Aim to submit it by the end of April, so that you can use the summer for intensive work on your dissertation.

_By now_:
* You have a supervisor and a supervisory committee.
* You have passed your exams. Congratulations!
* You’ve begun the process of formulating a dissertation, in consultation with your supervisor and committee.
* You have an idea of the seminar paper you’d like to rework into a published article.
* You have applied for SCMS with work related to the first chapter of your dissertation.

#### Year 2: The end of coursework, and exams
* One term of coursework (September through December).
* This proseminar!
* Select a supervisor (September, or at the latest, October). (NB: The [PhD handbook](./phd_handbook_2018.pdf) specifies this deadline is November 15. I believe you should do this much sooner. See the next point.)
* Declare your two special fields “by the end of the first week of December.” (The form will ask for a preface and a bibliography. It is not plausible to meet with a supervisor on November 15 and have your special fields hammered out, even in draft form, in three weeks.) Note that this declaration is preliminary; continue to work with your supervisor & committee to refine the lists through March.
* Study for special field exams (December through June).
* Take special field exams: May and/or June.
* Continue to develop your intellectual problems, formulating an idea for a dissertation (throughout the year).
* Begin work in earnest on a dissertation proposal (July & August).
* Write an abstract for a presentation at SCMS, preferably presenting what you’re proposing as your first chapter. Do this in consultation with your supervisor, even if that feels like overkill.
* End of August: apply for SCMS with dissertation-related work (preferably from your first chapter). SCMS applications are typically due the last day in August.

_By now_:
* You have an rough idea for a dissertation—or a collection of intersecting problems.
* You have an idea of whom you’d like to serve as your supervisor.

#### Year 1: Coursework
* Take all the classes.
* Write a lot of seminar papers.
* Develop a set of intellectual problems.
* Get the lay of the land: faculty, students, etc.

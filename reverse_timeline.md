# A reverse timeline
This document serves as a regulative ideal, where the eventual goal is tenure at a research-intensive institution (R1). That said, this ideal is _very, very rare_. Your author's path to tenure did not follow this template exactly, and many of the faculty members in CSI did not, either. This is a starting point for the inevitable improvisation, and departures from this path are not only _not failures_, but also sometimes cause for celebration. Also, it is worth noting that this is, as a general rule, a conservative and somewhat over-performing timeline: tenure standards may fully consider a book whose final manuscript has been submitted; you may well get a job with a single essay accepted. (By the same token, some institutions have _higher_ tenure standards; getting on the tenure track may require a more substantial research portfolio than I present here, particularly at certain kinds of institutions.)

### The tenure-track faculty timeline
#### Year 6: The tenure case
* Manage your anxiety about high-stakes judgment from your tenured peers & colleagues.
* Continue work on your second project, submitting an article from it.

_By this point_:
* Book in press or in print.
* 5+ (a minimum of 3) essays/articles in print or in press, 2 (minimum of 1) which should not be from the book.
* A second major project framed and under way.
* Tenure case submitted.

#### Year 5: The second project and the tenure case
* Move the book through the production processâ€”subventions, images & permissions, copy editing, proofing, indexing, etc.
* Present initial work from your second project at two conferences
* Prepare and submit an essay from second major project.
* Prepare your tenure file; processes differ from institution to institution, but it will be due somewhere between May and September.

_By this point_:
* Final book manuscript submitted.
* A second major project framed.
* 2 or 3 essays drawn from/related to the book published or in press.

#### Year 4: Completing your book, while pivoting to the next project
* Finish revisions to the book and resubmit the (hopefully final) manuscript.
* Read, research, develop, and deepen your second project; propose material from the second project to major conferences.
* At many (research-intensive) institutions, you may have a semester off in this year. Use this time to complete your manuscript.

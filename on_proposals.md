# On proposing dissertations
## An opinionated guide

This document, like many of the documents on this site, Scott’s opinion, and has not been formally vetted by the relevant parties. Your supervisor’s word takes precedence, and so does the graduate coordinator’s.

### The formal requirements
The following is, verbatim, the CSI PhD handbook’s enumeration of the requirements of a dissertation proposal:

* The thesis proposal shall contain:
  - An abstract/statement of intervention
  - A literature review
  - A detailed discussion of each chapter
  - A bibliography
  - A mediagraphy

* The abstract will typically be no more than one page, single-spaced.
*  The literature review will detail the existing literature—secondary and primary—pertaining to the thesis topic, less to demonstrate rote knowledge of that literature than to explicate how the thesis is an intervention into and extension of that literature.
* Chapter discussions will clearly detail the focus and argument of each chapter, as well as how each relates to the larger argument of the thesis.
* The scope of the bibliography and mediagraphy should be adequate to the topic.

### Scott’s advice
I have a number of ideas about how to propose a dissertation. This is, effectively, the advice I give all my students.

#### Nobody will hold you to this.
It may feel like you’re writing a contract of a document you must deliver. That is not how we think about this, _at all_. Literally every dissertation I have ever known, or known about, departs from its proposal. Often, for the author, this moment feels like a crisis; it need not. Nobody who’s reading the thing (on the committee, or, eventually, in the world) has any attachment to the proposal. The dissertation will take the shape you need it to as you write it. Write the proposal, therefore, as much as you can, from the posture of fantasizing about how smart you’ll be someday.

#### This document doesn’t matter very much. And how it matters will surprise you.
Sorry for the clickbait title. But this document serves two purposes:
* It will serve as a scaffold for you to get your research and writing program for your dissertation up and running. That is, it should tell you, to a reasonable degree of resolution, what your first next steps are. It does not need to tell you very much at all about what your final steps are.
* It will serve as a prompt for the conversation about your research at your dissertation proposal conference. There should be enough in this document that you and your committee can have a rich and challenging conversation for 90 minutes at your proposal conference.

More to the point, this document, like all research proposals, is an exercise in plausible faking it. It really does have to be plausible, but the conversations you will have with your supervisor(y committee) about this document are the important thing; the actual content of the document matters less. When in doubt, make it up.

#### Don’t get bogged down defensive reading.
A corollary to this: do not read all the things (or try to) before you put pen to paper. You’ll often have a sense of what you will need to read as part of your research; you do not need to have done that _before_ you propose the research. Do as much reading as you need to in order to sketch your idea, to get the outlines and major gestures plausible, but not more.

#### We do not want you to have solved all the problems.
Students at this stage frequently feel stuck at almost every turn. Many times, this takes the form of defensive reading. But this stuckness also often stems from a feeling like you have to have solved every problem you feel as pressing, addressed every concern you have that your argument isn’t watertight. That you have to discover what the argument of your dissertation is before you write it. But actually: those problems are where the research happens! So articulate the problems, lean into them, describe them, talk through them with your friends and loved ones and supervisory committee. (Okay, maybe leave mom out of it.)

I always suggest to my students that they write their proposals with a section at the end that is the place to put all the impasses they encounter while writing, phrasing them as questions for their supervisory committee. Different supervisors may have different ideas about whether you ought to leave that section in. (I think you should; my colleagues may not.) My experience is that this works very well: it often unsticks problems students are having by allowing them to pose it as a question for faculty, and it has the added benefit of serving as something of an agenda for the dissertation proposal conference. (Although also often in my experience, the problems the faculty members feel are pressing aren’t what the student feels as pressing. But that is a different matter.)

#### We do not want you to write a literature review.
Your proposal will include a section entitled “Literature Review.” We do not want a literature review. Note that the formal specifications even state that this section serves “less to demonstrate rote knowledge of that literature than to explicate how the thesis is an intervention into and extension of that literature.” Point being, we _do not really want you to write a literature review_. We want you to motivate the project with respect to the scholarly conversations you want to participate in. Think of this section as “Motivation” or “Rationale” rather than “Literature Review.”

Note that we do not require you to write a methods section. (This wouldn’t be my choice.) But if you are thinking about this “Literature Review (not a literature review)” section as laying out your reasons for pursuing your project—and for pursuing it in the way you plan to do so—this section will definitely address some of the whys and wherefores of the chapters.

The short version: the purpose of the second section of your dissertation proposal, whatever its title, is not to prove you have done your homework to a committee who is evaluating you. Instead, it is the place where you develop a story about why you think this project is important—both to you as a scholar, _and to the communities of scholarly practice in which you want to participate_.

#### We are not examining you.
The special field exams are the last time your supervisor and supervisory committee are _examining_ you & your performance. At the dissertation proposal stage, and until you graduate (and ideally until you get tenure), your supervisory committee are more like coaches than teachers. Our job is to encourage you, and to give you the practices and resources you need to complete your dissertation and develop a profile as a researcher. Sometimes that may mean telling you that what you’ve produced isn’t up to snuff, but that’s less about counting up failures and assessing marks than it is giving you important information about your performance so that you can improve it.

This is a very hard shift to accomplish for many reasons, but leading with your (scholarly) vulnerability is going to serve you _very well_ here. Do not think you must impress us by knowing all the things. We all constantly live in a state of not having read things that are vitally important to our peers and colleagues; knowing things on their own simply isn’t very impressive. Think that you should articulate your needs and desires well enough for us to help you get where you want to go.

#### Plan for unfinished business.
A modal dissertation in cinema studies has four chapters (of 40ish pages), as well as an introduction and conclusion. Propose five. Plan on only writing four. The idea here is that you should have plans to hit the ground running in your research career after your dissertation. A dissertation is a _process_ document, not a _product_ document. (See below.) But the unfinished business is where your “research trajectory” takes root, and it will be very good to have that trajectory in your back pocket when you are staying an extra year in the program, or when you are applying for postdocs, or in a job interview and are asked about your research program.

#### What a dissertation does.
It’s useful to know what a dissertation does when you propose one. My just-so story about a dissertation is that it does three things. It:
* Teaches you, by doing, how to have a nearly book-sized thought and how to execute a nearly book-sized research project. (The only way to learn this is by doing it.)
* Serves as a resource for job market materials. Its most notable functions are as a prop for a statement of a research program, and as an archive of other materials including a writing sample, a job talk, a published essay.
* Serves as a token of professionalization: you give it to a committee, they confer on you a PhD. This is the lowest bar to clear and in many ways the least important function. It’s the floor; aim higher than the floor.

Eric Hayot has an additional idea of what a dissertation does in _The Elements of Academic Style_, which is: it serves as a waypoint on the way to a book. I suspect this is also a good way of thinking about it. A dissertation should be an undercooked part of a book, where finishing the bake and adding an additional chapter or two are what happens in the five years after finishing it.

#### On the relation between exams and dissertations.
Nobody will care what your special fields are, starting approximately the moment the committee signs the paperwork saying you’ve passed. Nobody has once asked me what my exams were about. (Because, dear reader, you surely are curious and really, nobody has asked: “Media, History, Technology,” “Embodiment and Normativity,” and “The Reality Affect.”) My exam lists did, in some ways, prepare me for my eventual dissertation project. But I also discovered that I needed to read a whole lot of phenomenological philosophy and perceptual psychology to write my dissertation, and these weren’t on my exam lists. This is not a failure on anybody’s part. Obviously, the more your dissertation bibliography overlaps with your special field exam lists, the better off you are. But I’m not convinced that it is a desideratum for special fields lists to read all the things with an eye towards your dissertation bibliography. Managing that much novelty for your exams is difficult, and not really part of the program.

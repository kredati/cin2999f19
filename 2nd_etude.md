### Étude the second

# Problem and Structure

## Preparation
#### Due to Slack at the beginning of class, Tues., Nov. 12
You have two very quick bits of preparation this week:
* To the best of your ability in not more than 10 minutes, write a Topic/Question/Problem sentence à la Booth (in chs. 3 & 4)
* Take a segment of your paper (in its current state, whatever that is; approx. 3pp., as a kind of "chunk" of argumentation) and write a paragraph-level outline: in a sentence or less, write down the point of each paragraph.
* Then, write a single-sentence summary of that segment---based on your knowledge of the prose of that segment, but relying as much as you can on the summaries you have produced.

## Lesson
#### In class on Tues., Nov. 12
We will work on improving topics, questions, and problems (especially problems).

We will also discuss what to do with these retroactive outlines (hint: it will build on characters & themes).

## Application
#### Due to Slack by end of Mon., Nov. 18
* Rework your Topic/Question/Problem sentence so that it's got a specific topic, a salient question, and a clearly articulated problem, tuned to your imagined audience.
* Revise the sentence-summary to use as many relevant critical key terms from your topic/question/problem sentence, paying particular attention to the subject of that sentence/your main character.
* For each paragraph in your segment, rewrite your sentence summaries to use your main character, and use as many themes from your t/q/p sentence as you can muster.

By this point, your t/q/p sentence, summary-sentence, and paragraph summaries should read as a series of statements about one main character and a few other subordinate characters. You will use this outline to revise that segment of your paper, including knowing what you might be able to cut.

That said, finally---and this is optional but recommended for the Nov. 18 exercise---peform a revision, rewriting each paragraph so that each of the most important critical terms in your sentence summary is a theme in the paragraph, and you're in control of your characters, with the main character of the segment being a main or major supporting character of the paragraph.

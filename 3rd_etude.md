### Étude the third

# Introductions

## Preparation
#### Due to Slack by end of day on Mon., Nov. 18
You have two slightly more involved bits of preparation this week:
* **Delimit your audience and your lesson.** Write down, in a few sentences or bullet points for each, the following bits of information:
  - who the audience for this paper is, 
  - the most important lesson you'd like to teach them (this very well may be a restatement of your problem from last week), 
  - what they need to know in order to learn that lesson that isn't either your direct topic or common knowledge amongs your audience,
  - why you think the lesson is important (or, if your lesson isn't your problem, then _this_ should be a restatment of your problem), 
  - and why you hope think they'll find that lesson important.
* **A stasis, its destabilization, a resolution, and its benefit.** This isn't the full Booth scheme, nor is it quite as rigorous, but it's a simplification/adaptation of their introductory pattern that I have found useful. Based on what you wrote above, write a sentence or two for each of the following bullet points:
  - Provide one possible _stasis_. A statis is what people in your audience are likely to think about some aspect of your topic before they learn your lesson.
  - Then, _destabilize_ that stasis, by saying how it's incomplete, or incorrect, or insufficiently precise, or badly posed, or some other way inadequate. (Another way to think about this is that it's ultimately a motivation for your lesson.)
  - Next, _resolve_ the destabilization, by stating your lesson, or at least the aspect of it that relates to the stasis & destabilization.
  - Finally, state the _benefit_ of your resolution, the reason why your audience should want to learn the lesson.
  
A few notes:
* Throughout, in this exercise, be sure to be use characters & themes from your paper and from your topic/question/problem sentence, since what you set up in the introduction in terms of main characters and key themes will set your readers' expectations for the balance of your paper. If you're not using the same themes & characters, it will feel like a bait and switch. (Unless, of course, you want to surprise your reader! But then you should be doing that intentionally.)
* Be as approximate as you need to be to get this done in a reasonably brief period of time: 15–20 minutes for each item is a good goal. Once you get there, stop. You'll be reworking things into actual prose; we'll talk about how to do that on Tuesday. For now, gestures, approxmiations, abbreviations are just fine. You're generating some raw material for the "application" phase.

## Lesson
#### In class on Tues., Nov. 19
We will discuss various stasises, destabilizations, resolutions, and benefits: how they fit together, pitfalls, etc.

## Application
#### Due by Monday, Nov. 25
Write a complete, plausible introduction to your paper.

## Étude the first
# On paragraphs

### Goals
The idea here is to revise a single of your paragraphs so that it is _really good_. We'll use methods both from Booth and from Hayot to revise a paragraph of your writing. As with all our études this term, we will have a preparation (that is largely diagnostic), an in-class lesson that demonstrates and workshops techniques we read about, and a follow-up that applies those techniques to your writing.

### Preparation
#### Due in class on Tuesday, October 29.
The preparation here is fairly straightfoward:
1. Select a paragraph you will revise.
2. Following Booth, circle or italicize every word that appears more than once in the paragraph.
3. Also following Booth, underline or boldface the _complete_ subject of every sentence: the complete noun phrase with any qualifying clauses or adjective phrases. In the following sentences, I have boldfaced the complete subjects:
  * **What Walter Benjamin can teach us about our current situation** lies mostly in his concept of reception in distraction.
  * **The argument Derrida makes in _Voice and Phenomenon_ about the voice as pure auto-affection, in which he reworks Husserl's argument about writing in _The Origin of Geometry_,** has led to an unfairly negative view of Husserl among readers of French theory.
  * **It** is important to understand the ways in which Laura Mulvey deploys Freud and Lacan.
4. Following Hayot, and using his scale, assign each sentence a a "level of abstraction" that makes sense in its context, from high-level theoretical claim to factual statement.

### Lesson 
#### In class on Tuesday, October 29.
In this lesson, as a class, we will arrange one of your sample paragraphs together so that it: 
1. uses themes in a controlled fashion, drawing together three different themes, and not more; 
2. puts subjects and verbs consistently as close together as possible, eschewing qualifying clauses and complex subjects; 
3. avoids impersonal subjects; 
4. uses consistent characters, matching your thematic strands, with two or perhaps three characters in the paragraph; and
5. is arranged so that it deploy's Hayot's "uneven U" structure.

### Application
#### Due to course Slack by Monday, November 11.
This will be labourious and a bit technical, but you should revise your paragraph using the techniques we work out together in class. Prepare a document that includes the original and the revised version. Your paragraph should meet all 5 criteria above.

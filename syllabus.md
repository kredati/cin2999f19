### Course description
This course is required of all second-year PhD students in the Cinema Studies Institute. The course aims to give students the para-academic skills they require to survive and thrive in the CSI PhD program, as researchers and teachers in the fields of cinema and media studies, and as professionals in the academy and beyond.

### Statement of principles
This is an impossible project for a single semester, and certainly you shouldn’t take my word as the last word on anything this term. I have what I take to be a healthy sense of my own limitations when it comes to matters professional, and so I have organized this course and our activities together along the following principles:
* **Maximizing critical & metacognitive awareness.** The idea here is that I am not telling you how it is, I am providing you prompts to encounter the professional activities and realities of higher education in 2019. You’ll get to make up your own minds.
* **Maximizing community inputs.** I have constructed this syllabus in consultation with a number of constituencies, including: my faculty colleagues in CSI; graduate students in later years of CSI’s PhD program; the students in this course; and also my academic peers at other institutions.
* **Maximizing supervisor contact.** The more advanced you get in academia, the more bespoke everything becomes. Much of what comes next for you—exams, a dissertation, a professionalization strategy—will be absolutely specific to you, your project, your interests, your talents, your networks. And so, instead of trying to tell you how to, e.g., approach exams in a general way, I instead am going to provide opportunities for (read: force) you to have conversations with your supervisors early and often about crucial matters of advising.
* **Minimizing busywork.** We will have a number of “homework” assignments; I have tried to ensure that each of those assignments is actionable in a direct way at some later point in the program.

### Outcomes
In this course, students will:
* Meet with their supervisor no fewer than three times.
* Discuss major advising and program goals with their supervisor, including (but not limited to) exams, publishing, conferences, and possible dissertation projects.
* Gain critical familiarity with all parts of academic life, including research (publishing, conferences, grants, writing), teaching, and service.
* Encounter and discuss all major milestones of the academic career path up to tenure.
* Read the work of, and engage in conversation with, a substantial number of CSI faculty.
* Develop awareness of themselves as writers and of their research, writing, and revising process.
* Revise one term paper from their first year coursework into a fully-realized conference paper.
* In the course of revising this paper, gain familiarity with one set of methods for understanding and revising academic writing.

### Coursework & marks
This course is pass/fail. To gain a passing mark, students must complete, to my satisfaction, all assignments in the course by their stated deadline. In other words: almost all of this is process-based; do the things, trust the process.

Be aware that this iteration of the proseminar is substantially different from previous iterations, in that it also includes a certain amount of reading. Please do the reading carefully; I would not ask you to do it if I didn’t think it important.
